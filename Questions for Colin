How were the birds captured? All nets or other methods?

Data collection techniques
Sherry referred to sampling effort in her email (# of net hours per day).   Are data on sampling effort available?
What do the extra banding codes (5, 6, 7, and R) mean?
Can we determine the resident/migrant statuses for the species whose statuses we couldn't determine?
